You can submit these files to JLCPCB as is.

### Bottom Camera

Use both M2 and M3 spacers to install the module accessing the location from the reels area.

I use 2x16mm M3 spacers (4 pairs), so total distance from YY1's hole to PCB is 32mm.

The length of M2 spacers does not matter.

### Bottom LED ring

Assemble LED ring PCB using AA4040SURSK part from Mouser.

Provide 1.95v to the LED ring (you can play with various voltages from 1.7 to 1.95 depending on brightness of your room). For now I am using bench power supply.

Install it using M3 spacers. I use 4mm for now, but still playing with length.

### Top Camera

Assemble the module using M2 spacers as on this picture:
