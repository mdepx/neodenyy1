### Cad files for camera modules


Submit zip files to JLCPCB.

### Bottom camera

Submit md024.zip to JLCPCB.

Once arrived use both M2 and M3 spacers to install it from the reels area.

### Bottom LED ring

Submit md023a.zip to JLCPCB.

Then assemble LED ring pcb using AA4040SURSK part from Mouser.

Provide 1.95v to the LED ring (you can play with various voltages from 1.7 to 1.95 depending on brightness of your room). For now I am using bench power supply.

Install it using M3 spacers.

### Top camera assembly

Submit md022d.zip to JLCPCB.

Assemble the module using M2 spacers as on this picture:
